22:07 - [BBG] Jerkakame: cool game
22:07 - [BBG] Jerkakame: BUT
22:07 - [BBG] Jerkakame: 2 things
22:08 - [BBG] Jerkakame: ¨bad controls
22:08 - [BBG] Jerkakame: just the X
22:08 - Digaly: HAHA yea
22:08 - Digaly: the X is bad?
22:08 - Digaly: what would you do to fix it?
22:08 - [BBG] Jerkakame: ctrl
22:08 - [BBG] Jerkakame: :3
22:08 - [BBG] Jerkakame: because you have to move your wasd fingers to X
22:08 - Digaly: wtf
22:08 - Digaly: I have my thumb on X
22:08 - [BBG] Jerkakame: it was hard enough on x3
22:08 - [BBG] Jerkakame: but thumb is on space
22:08 - Digaly: oh
22:08 - Digaly: yea
22:08 - Digaly: shit
22:08 - Digaly: thanks
22:09 - Digaly: I made it to x6 B3
22:09 - [BBG] Jerkakame: space was weird but got used to
22:09 - [BBG] Jerkakame: better would be maybe   arrow keys
22:09 - Digaly: arrow keys instead of space?
22:09 - Digaly: or arrow keys instead of wasd
22:09 - [BBG] Jerkakame: yea
22:09 - Digaly: oh
22:09 - [BBG] Jerkakame: that way you can pitch upwards and downwards too
22:09 - [BBG] Jerkakame: up and down tunnels
22:09 - [BBG] Jerkakame: the split way thingy was cool
22:10 - Digaly: but you can already pitch up and down with W and S right?
22:10 - [BBG] Jerkakame: iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
22:10 - [BBG] Jerkakame: no
22:10 - [BBG] Jerkakame: it just moves up and down
22:10 - Digaly: ah yea
22:10 - Digaly: I see what you mean
22:11 - [BBG] Jerkakame: I died because of the draw distance
22:11 - Digaly: yea
22:11 - [BBG] Jerkakame: didnt see the tunnel go to the right before it was too late
22:11 - [BBG] Jerkakame: too fast speed
22:11 - [BBG] Jerkakame: :3
22:11 - [BBG] Jerkakame: and    the ship is too big
22:11 - [BBG] Jerkakame: or I dunno
22:11 - Digaly: that's a big problem
22:11 - [BBG] Jerkakame: it was hard to know where the ship was
22:11 - [BBG] Jerkakame: when i started it and went down a bit and died
22:12 - [BBG] Jerkakame: was like "HOW DID I DIE    oh I touched the bottom"
22:12 - Digaly: yea, good point
22:12 - [BBG] Jerkakame: same with the wall I hit and some lasers
22:12 - [BBG] Jerkakame: dunno how to fix good
22:12 - [BBG] Jerkakame: but putting a shadow under it would be easiest
22:12 - [BBG] Jerkakame: :3
22:12 - Digaly: Yes!
22:12 - Digaly: Good fucking ideas
22:12 - Digaly: gonna copy paste
